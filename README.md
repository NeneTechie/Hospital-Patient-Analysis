### Hospital-Patient-Analysis

Hospital Visit Analysis (Power BI Project)

This Power BI project explores hospital visit data to uncover key trends in patient volume, admission methods, and departmental loads. The goal is to provide actionable insights to hospital administrators for optimizing resource allocation and improving patient care.

Project Structure

- `Hospital_Visit_Dashboard.pbix` – Power BI report file
- `hospital_visits_dataset.csv` – Cleaned dataset used for this analysis
- `Insights.md` – Data-driven insights extracted from the visuals
- `Recommendations.md` – Business recommendations based on insights

Dashboard Overview

The Power BI dashboard provides interactive visuals for:

Monthly Trends – Patient visits over time
Top Departments – Departments with the highest patient loads
Admission Methods – Proportion of emergency, referral, and scheduled admissions
Demographics – Gender and age distribution of patients
Peak Periods – Hourly and daily visit volume

Key Features

- Cleaned data using Power Query
- DAX formulas for calculated metrics (e.g. average length of stay)
- Slicers and filters for user-friendly interactivity
- Color-coded KPIs for faster comprehension

Tools Used

- Microsoft Power BI
- Power Query Editor (M language)
- DAX for calculated columns/measures
- Excel (for data preprocessing)

Sample Insights

> See full insights in `Power Point Document`.

- 60% of visits occurred during weekdays, peaking on Tuesdays
- The Emergency department accounted for 38% of total visits
- Most admissions occurred between 10 AM and 2 PM
- Female patients slightly outnumbered male patients by 5%

Recommendations

> See full details in `Power Point Document`.

- Allocate more staff to the Emergency and Pediatrics departments
- Extend staffing coverage during peak hours (10 AM – 2 PM)
- Encourage referral programs to reduce emergency burden

Learning Outcome

This project helped demonstrate the full data analysis pipeline using Power BI – from raw data cleaning in Power Query, building a data model, creating visuals, to deriving actionable business insights.
